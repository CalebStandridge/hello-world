# hello-world
Doing the tutorial

I just want to learn C++ for personal projects. I'm currently working through "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming, Fourth Edition" by Michael Dawson, chapter 7. I thought I may as well get a GitHub account, just in case I ever need it.

I'm very new to programming; the only serious work I've ever done is in Matlab which is very different from C++, so I'm excited to learn what I can.

Adios, Spaceman.
